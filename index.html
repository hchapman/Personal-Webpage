<p>I am Harrison Chapman and I am currently a graduate student in the University of Georgia's department of mathematics working towards a Ph.D. degree. I graduated from Bowdoin College in May of 2011 with a B.A. in Mathematics and Computer Science.</p>

<p>I am not entirely certain of my desired research area, I have previously
researched Sudoku and similar problems using algebraic geometry, and I have written an honors ehesis at Bowdoin on nilpotent orbits in the Lie group of type A.</p>
